#	__1__ should be the first parameter used, but does not have to be at the beginning
#	__2__ should always be at the end
#	__3__ should *always* be accompanied by the color
#	__3__ (and the color) are only usable for `-by` and `-by-with`
#	__4__ is only usable for `-by-with`
#	the index at the beginning should always follow the one before it
#	Please credit yourself or whoever wrote it

#	Vanilla damages:
#		physical is the default and a catch-all, but you can think of it as bullets and biter attacks
#		impact is a collision with a vehicle
#		fire is of course fire
#		acid is the spit of worms and spitters
#		poison is the poison capsule
#		laser is the laser turrets and such
#		electric is the destroyer capsule
#	Keep in mind these are *base game* uses. Any usage that's specific to these
#	might become slightly incorrect when encountering a modded damage source

# i-[damage]					= is the basic death
# i-[damage]-by-self	= is a self inflicted death
# i-[damage]-by				= is a murder by an entity or player
# i-[damage]-by-with	= is a murder by a player with a vehicle
