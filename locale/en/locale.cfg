# __1__ player who died
# __2__ gps tag of death location
# __3__ What/Who killed the player
# __4__ What was used to kill the player

# __1__ should be the first parameter used, but does not have to be at the beginning
# __2__ should always be at the end
# __3__ are only usable for `-by` and `-by-with`
# __4__ is only usable for `-by-with`
# the index at the beginning should always follow the one before it
# Please credit yourself or whoever wrote it

# Vanilla damages:
	# physical is the default and a catch-all, but you can think of it as bullets and biter attacks
	# impact is a collision with a vehicle
	# fire is of course fire
	# acid is the spit of worms and spitters
	# poison is the poison capsule
	# laser is the laser turrets and such
	# electric is the destroyer capsule
# Keep in mind these are *base game* uses. Any usage that's specific to these
# might become slightly incorrect when encountering a modded damage source

# i-[damage]					= is the basic death
# i-[damage]-by-self	= is a self inflicted death
# i-[damage]-by				= is a murder by an entity or player
# i-[damage]-by-with	= is a murder by a player with a vehicle
